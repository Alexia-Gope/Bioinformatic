#MISA (MIcroSAtellite Identification Tool) allows the identification and localization of perfect microsatellites
#as well as compound microsatellites which are interrupted by a certain number of bases.

#Output:
#Results of the microsatellite search are stored in two files:
#In "<FASTfile>.misa" the localization and type of identified microsatellite(s) are stored in a tablewise manner.
#The file "<FASTfile>.statistics" summarizes different statistics as the frequency of a specific microsatellite type according to the unit size or individual motifs.
